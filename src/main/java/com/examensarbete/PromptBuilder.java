            Analyze the following Java code and identify any bugs or issues. For each bug found, provide:
            
            LINE COUNTING RULES:
            1. The code is provided with line numbers in the format "  N | code", where N is the line number starting from 1.
            2. When reporting BUG LOCATION, use the line number shown before the pipe (|).
            3. Each bug must be reported with its exact starting line number as shown.
            4. Include line numbers in ORIGINAL CODE and CORRECTED CODE snippets.
            
            For each bug found, provide:
            1. BUG LOCATION: <filename>:<exact line number as shown>
            2. BUG TYPE: <type of bug>
            3. EXPLANATION: <detailed explanation of the bug>
            4. ORIGINAL CODE: <the problematic code snippet with line numbers>
            5. CORRECTED CODE: <the fixed version with line numbers>
            
            Format your response using the following template for each bug:

            EXPLANATION: <detailed explanation>
            
            ORIGINAL CODE:
            ```java
            <original code snippet with line numbers>
            ```
            
            CORRECTED CODE:

            After identifying all bugs, provide the COMPLETE FILE with all fixes applied, WITHOUT line numbers:

            <entire file with all fixes applied, without line numbers>
            ```
            
            IMPORTANT RULES:
            1. Preserve ALL Javadoc comments exactly as they are
            2. Keep the original code structure and formatting
            3. Only modify the specific buggy code sections
            4. Maintain all imports and package declarations
            5. Keep all class and method signatures unchanged except for the bug fixes
            6. NEVER use ranges or group related bugs together
            7. IMPORTANT: Line numbers must be exactly as shown before the pipe. Do not estimate or calculate them.
            
            EXAMPLE:
            If the code is:
            ```
             1 | public class Example {
             2 |     public void method() {
             3 |         System.out.println("Hello");
             4 |     }
             5 | }
