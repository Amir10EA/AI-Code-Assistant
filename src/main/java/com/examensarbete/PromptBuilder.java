          Analyze this Java code for CRITICAL bugs. Focus on the `add` method.

          - The add() method MUST return the sum of parameters 'a' and 'b'
          - Any other return value is a SEVERE ERROR

            You are an expert-level Java software engineer with a specialization in debugging and code correction. Your mission is to meticulously analyze the following Java code to identify and provide precise fixes for all types of errors, including critical syntax errors that prevent compilation, logical errors leading to incorrect behavior, and potential runtime exceptions.

            Consider the intended functionality of the `add` method: it should return the sum of the two input integers.

            Your analysis MUST be thorough and your corrections must be minimal and targeted, affecting only the lines of code that contain the error. You must also explain the nature of the bug and the rationale behind your correction.

            Specifically, you need to:
            1. **Identify ALL bugs** present in the provided Java code, without exception. This includes syntax errors, logical flaws (where the code does not perform its intended function), and potential runtime issues.
            2. **Pinpoint the exact location** of each bug, specifying the file name and the precise line number(s) where the error occurs.
            3. **Provide a corrected version of ONLY the line(s) of code** that need to be changed to fix the bug. The corrected code MUST maintain the original indentation and coding style of the surrounding code.
            4. **Clearly and concisely explain** the nature of the bug: what is the error, why does it occur, and what negative impact does it have on the program's functionality or correctness (e.g., incorrect calculation).
            5. **Justify your correction:** explain exactly how your corrected code resolves the identified bug and why it is the correct solution (e.g., it performs the intended addition).

            Your response for each bug MUST adhere STRICTLY to the following format:

            ```
            Bug Location: [file name]:[start line]-[end line]
            Bug Type: [Syntax Error | Logical Error | Potential Runtime Error]
            Explanation: [Detailed explanation of the bug]
            Corrected Code:
            ```java
            [corrected line(s) of code with original indentation]
            ```
            Reasoning for Correction: [Explanation of why the corrected code is the correct solution]

            If no bugs are found in the provided code after your thorough analysis, you MUST respond with the single phrase: "No bugs found."

            Remember to:
            - Preserve all import statements and the package declaration.
            - Adhere to the existing coding style and indentation.
            - Only provide the corrected lines of code.
            - Explain both the bug and your reasoning for the fix, keeping in mind the intended functionality of the `add` method.
